# Assembly Memory Access Bug

This repository demonstrates a potential bug in assembly code where the access to a memory location relies on register values.  If those register values are incorrect, it leads to accessing invalid memory addresses. This can result in a segmentation fault or other unpredictable behavior, making debugging difficult.

## Bug Description:
The `mov eax, [ebx + ecx*4 + 0x10]` instruction calculates a memory address based on `ebx`, `ecx`, and a constant offset. If any of these registers hold incorrect values, the resulting memory address could be out of bounds.

## Solution:
The solution involves carefully checking the values in registers `ebx` and `ecx` before the memory access to ensure they are within the expected range of valid memory addresses. This would prevent out-of-bounds memory access that leads to crashes.
