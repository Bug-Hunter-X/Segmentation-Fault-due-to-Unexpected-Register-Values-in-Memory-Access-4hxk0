mov eax, [ebx + ecx*4 + 0x10]

This instruction attempts to access memory at an address calculated as ebx + ecx*4 + 0x10.  If any of these registers contain unexpected values (e.g., due to an earlier bug or incorrect calculation), it could lead to accessing memory outside the program's allocated space, resulting in a segmentation fault or other unpredictable behavior.
